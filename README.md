<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p>This project is a depiction of the HTML, CSS, and Flexbox skills I am learning through The Odin Project's cirriculum. This project should be viewed from a computer or tablet, it is not optimized for mobile.</p>
<p>In this project I showcased:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Building and adding content to an HTML page.</li>
  <li>Styling HTML elements with CSS.</li>
  <li>Manipulating the position of HTML elements with CSS Flexbox.</li>
  <li>Improvement of Git usage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things to Improve Upon</h2>
<p>Going into this project, the only guidance provided was <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png">this</a> reference image and <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png">this</a> list of fonts and colors. The project was daunting at first but taking it step by step made it much smoother. Having only a reference image and list of fonts was great because it allowed me to truly practice my skills and find answers to things that I didn't know on my own. Up to this point only some 'best practices' have been taught, so at the moment the HTML and CSS code are not as efficient as they could be.</p>
<p>That being said, here are some things to improve upon for next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Efficient code & HTMl/CSS knowledge. - I haven't had enought practice or learned enough about 'best practices' for HTML CSS, and Flexbox yet. My skills will improve with time, practice, and increased knowledge.</li>
  <li>Git usage. - My git usage was relatively sparse during this project. I need to learn more about the best times to commit.</li>
  <li>More and more. - There are always things to improve upon, the things above stood out to me the most.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project and the hands-off approach that it provided. It made me think, research, apply, rethink, apply, and so on. It was frustrating at times and satisfying when things finally came together. Even though my code is not the best or most efficient right now, I am proud of my progress so far and will continue to get better!</p>
